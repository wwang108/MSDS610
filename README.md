We used a simple and clean dataset to explain the basic process of linear regression and split our presentation into three parts:

1. Briefly introduced linear regression. ***(Chenxi Li)***
2. Explained how to estimate the parameters in linear regression model by hand and using Python packages (OLSE). ***(Matt Wheeler)***
